### Critical Data Routing Patterns (Production Implementation)

#### 1. Complete RP Training Workflow
```typescript
// Mesocycle Creation → Session Generation → Execution → Auto-Regulation → Volume Updates
const mesocycleId = await MesocyclePeriodization.createMesocycleWithProgram(userId, templateId)
// Creates: mesocycles.id → workout_sessions (3-4 per week) → workout_exercises (4-6 per session)

// Session Completion with Integrated Data Recording
await WorkoutCompletion.complete(sessionId, exerciseData)
// Auto-records: workout_exercises.performance → load_progression_tracking → auto_regulation_feedback
// Triggers: volume_landmarks updates using RP algorithms
```

#### 2. Renaissance Periodization Auto-Regulation
```typescript
// RP Volume Adjustment Algorithm
const recoveryScore = (soreness * 0.3 + effort * 0.3 + energy * 0.25 + sleep * 0.15)
const adaptationScore = (pumpQuality * 0.7 + volumeCompletion * 0.3)
const volumeAdjustment = calculateRPVolumeChange(recoveryScore, adaptationScore)
// Updates: volume_landmarks.current_volume → next week's workout_exercises.sets
```

#### 3. Nutrition RP Diet Coach Integration
```typescript
// Meal Timing with RP Methodology
const mealPlan = await RPDietCoach.generateMealPlan(userId, workoutSchedule)
// Creates: meal_timing_preferences → meal_macro_distribution → nutrition_logs
// Applies: RP nutrient timing (pre-workout carbs, post-workout protein)
```

#### 4. Analytics Data Pipeline
```typescript
// Comprehensive Analytics with Time Synchronization
const analytics = await AnalyticsService.getComprehensiveAnalytics(userId, days)
// Aggregates: nutrition_logs + workout_sessions + body_metrics + auto_regulation_feedback
// Returns: overview.weightChange, training.consistency, nutrition.adherence, feedback.recoveryScore
```

#### 5. Data Quality & Synchronization
```typescript
// Enhanced Date Handling with created_at Priority
const sortedData = data.sort((a, b) => {
  const dateComparison = new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date)
  return dateComparison === 0 ? new Date(a.created_at) - new Date(b.created_at) : dateComparison
})
// Ensures: Latest entry priority for same-date multiple entries
// Time Sync: TimeSyncService.getCurrentTime() for accurate date operations
```

### Data Validation Rules

#### Required Foreign Key Relationships
- workout_sessions.mesocycle_id → mesocycles.id (NOT NULL for mesocycle-based sessions)
- workout_exercises.session_id → workout_sessions.id (NOT NULL)
- auto_regulation_feedback.session_id → workout_sessions.id (NOT NULL)
- volume_landmarks.user_id → users.id (NOT NULL)
- volume_landmarks.muscle_group_id → muscle_groups.id (NOT NULL)

#### Data Type Constraints
- All decimal fields: precision: 5, scale: 2 (e.g., 999.99 format)
- All percentage fields: 0-100 range validation
- RPE/RIR fields: 1-10 integer range
- Boolean fields: explicit true/false (not nullable unless specified)
- Array fields: use .array() method syntax in schema definition

#### Critical Null Handling
- workout_sessions.program_id: nullable (mesocycle sessions don't require program)
- workout_exercises.actual_reps: nullable (until exercise completed)
- workout_exercises.rpe/rir: nullable (until exercise completed)
- exercises.movement_pattern: ensure proper null handling in type definitions

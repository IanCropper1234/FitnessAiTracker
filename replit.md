## Data Architecture & Routing Logic

### Core Data Flow Architecture (Current Implementation)

**Primary Entity Relationships:**
```
users (1) → (many) mesocycles → (many) workout_sessions → (many) workout_exercises
users (1) → (many) auto_regulation_feedback → load_progression_tracking
users (1) → (many) volume_landmarks ↔ muscle_groups (with auto-regulation coupling)
users (1) → (many) nutrition_logs → food_database (via AI analysis + RP categorization)
mesocycles (1) → (many) workout_sessions ↔ load_progression_tracking (priority integration)
```

**Modern Training System Data Flow (2025):**
1. **Mesocycle Creation** → Auto-generates targeted workout_sessions with volume progression
2. **Session Execution** → Dynamic set/rep management + real-time progress tracking
3. **Session Completion** → Auto-records load_progression_tracking + triggers auto_regulation_feedback
4. **Feedback Analysis** → Updates volume_landmarks via RP algorithms + calculates fatigue accumulation
5. **Week Advancement** → Recalculates volume targets + auto-adjusts upcoming workout weights
6. **Load Progression Integration** → Prioritizes mesocycle-adjusted weights over historical performance data

### Critical Data Routing Patterns (Production Implementation)

#### 1. Complete RP Training Workflow
```typescript
// Mesocycle Creation → Session Generation → Execution → Auto-Regulation → Volume Updates
const mesocycleId = await MesocyclePeriodization.createMesocycleWithProgram(userId, templateId)
// Creates: mesocycles.id → workout_sessions (3-4 per week) → workout_exercises (4-6 per session)

// Session Completion with Integrated Data Recording
await WorkoutCompletion.complete(sessionId, exerciseData)
// Auto-records: workout_exercises.performance → load_progression_tracking → auto_regulation_feedback
// Triggers: volume_landmarks updates using RP algorithms
```

#### 2. Renaissance Periodization Auto-Regulation
```typescript
// RP Volume Adjustment Algorithm
const recoveryScore = (soreness * 0.3 + effort * 0.3 + energy * 0.25 + sleep * 0.15)
const adaptationScore = (pumpQuality * 0.7 + volumeCompletion * 0.3)
const volumeAdjustment = calculateRPVolumeChange(recoveryScore, adaptationScore)
// Updates: volume_landmarks.current_volume → next week's workout_exercises.sets
```

#### 3. Nutrition RP Diet Coach Integration
```typescript
// Meal Timing with RP Methodology
const mealPlan = await RPDietCoach.generateMealPlan(userId, workoutSchedule)
// Creates: meal_timing_preferences → meal_macro_distribution → nutrition_logs
// Applies: RP nutrient timing (pre-workout carbs, post-workout protein)
```

#### 4. Analytics Data Pipeline
```typescript
// Comprehensive Analytics with Time Synchronization
const analytics = await AnalyticsService.getComprehensiveAnalytics(userId, days)

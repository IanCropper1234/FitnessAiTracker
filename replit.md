## Data Architecture & Routing Logic

### Core Data Flow Architecture (Current Implementation)

**Primary Entity Relationships:**
```
users (1) → (many) mesocycles → (many) workout_sessions → (many) workout_exercises
users (1) → (many) auto_regulation_feedback → load_progression_tracking
users (1) → (many) volume_landmarks ↔ muscle_groups (with auto-regulation coupling)
users (1) → (many) nutrition_logs → food_database (via AI analysis + RP categorization)
mesocycles (1) → (many) workout_sessions ↔ load_progression_tracking (priority integration)
```

**Modern Training System Data Flow (2025):**
1. **Mesocycle Creation** → Auto-generates targeted workout_sessions with volume progression
2. **Session Execution** → Dynamic set/rep management + real-time progress tracking
3. **Session Completion** → Auto-records load_progression_tracking + triggers auto_regulation_feedback
4. **Feedback Analysis** → Updates volume_landmarks via RP algorithms + calculates fatigue accumulation
5. **Week Advancement** → Recalculates volume targets + auto-adjusts upcoming workout weights
6. **Load Progression Integration** → Prioritizes mesocycle-adjusted weights over historical performance data

### Critical Data Routing Patterns (Current Implementation)

#### Mesocycle-Centric Session Creation
```typescript
// Modern mesocycle creation with targeted programming
const mesocycleId = await MesocyclePeriodization.createMesocycleWithProgram(
  userId, name, templateId, totalWeeks, customProgram
)
// Auto-generates: workout_sessions with mesocycle_id linkage + exercise assignments
// Links: mesocycles.id → workout_sessions.mesocycle_id → workout_exercises.session_id
```

#### Dynamic Session Execution & Load Progression
```typescript
// Session completion triggers comprehensive data recording
await WorkoutCompletion.complete(sessionId, {
  exercises: [{ exerciseId, sets: [{ weight, reps, rpe, rir }] }]
})
// Auto-records: workout_exercises.performance + load_progression_tracking.data
// Triggers: auto_regulation_feedback collection + volume_landmarks updates
```

#### Integrated Feedback & Auto-Regulation
```typescript
// Feedback triggers volume and load progression adjustments
const feedback = await AutoRegulationFeedback.create(sessionId, feedbackData)
const volumeUpdates = await MesocyclePeriodization.updateVolumeLandmarks(userId, feedback)
const loadRecommendations = await LoadProgression.getWorkoutProgressions(userId)
// Updates: volume_landmarks + mesocycle progression + load progression recommendations
```

#### Advanced Week Progression with Load Integration
```typescript
// Week advancement with integrated load progression priorities
const advancement = await MesocyclePeriodization.advanceWeek(mesocycleId)
const loadAlignment = await LoadProgression.getWorkoutProgressions(userId)
// Priority System: mesocycle-adjusted weights (90% confidence) > historical data (75% confidence)
// Updates: mesocycles.current_week + workout_exercises.weight + volume targets
```

#### Load Progression Priority Integration
```typescript
// Load progression prioritizes mesocycle programming over historical data
const recommendations = await LoadProgression.getWorkoutProgressions(userId)
// Data Priority: 
// 1. Upcoming mesocycle workouts (auto-adjusted by Advance Week)
// 2. Historical performance data (for non-mesocycle exercises)
// Result: Aligned recommendations showing mesocycle-adjusted weights
```

### Data Validation Rules

#### Required Foreign Key Relationships
- workout_sessions.mesocycle_id → mesocycles.id (NOT NULL for mesocycle-based sessions)
- workout_exercises.session_id → workout_sessions.id (NOT NULL)
- auto_regulation_feedback.session_id → workout_sessions.id (NOT NULL)
- volume_landmarks.user_id → users.id (NOT NULL)
- volume_landmarks.muscle_group_id → muscle_groups.id (NOT NULL)

#### Data Type Constraints
- All decimal fields: precision: 5, scale: 2 (e.g., 999.99 format)
- All percentage fields: 0-100 range validation
- RPE/RIR fields: 1-10 integer range
- Boolean fields: explicit true/false (not nullable unless specified)
- Array fields: use .array() method syntax in schema definition

#### Critical Null Handling
- workout_sessions.program_id: nullable (mesocycle sessions don't require program)
- workout_exercises.actual_reps: nullable (until exercise completed)
- workout_exercises.rpe/rir: nullable (until exercise completed)
- exercises.movement_pattern: ensure proper null handling in type definitions

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with shared TypeScript schemas between client and server
2. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod validation for runtime type checking
3. **Component Architecture**: Modular React components with proper separation of concerns
4. **Database Design**: Normalized schema with proper foreign key relationships and indexing
5. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling and response formats
6. **Internationalization**: Built-in from the start with database-stored translations for dynamic content
7. **Authentication Flow**: Session-based auth with bcrypt hashing and proper error handling

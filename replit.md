### Critical Data Routing Patterns (Production Implementation)

#### 1. Complete RP Training Workflow
```typescript
// Mesocycle Creation → Session Generation → Execution → Auto-Regulation → Volume Updates
const mesocycleId = await MesocyclePeriodization.createMesocycleWithProgram(userId, templateId)
// Creates: mesocycles.id → workout_sessions (3-4 per week) → workout_exercises (4-6 per session)

// Session Completion with Integrated Data Recording
await WorkoutCompletion.complete(sessionId, exerciseData)
// Auto-records: workout_exercises.performance → load_progression_tracking → auto_regulation_feedback
// Triggers: volume_landmarks updates using RP algorithms
```

#### 2. Renaissance Periodization Auto-Regulation
```typescript
// RP Volume Adjustment Algorithm
const recoveryScore = (soreness * 0.3 + effort * 0.3 + energy * 0.25 + sleep * 0.15)
const adaptationScore = (pumpQuality * 0.7 + volumeCompletion * 0.3)
const volumeAdjustment = calculateRPVolumeChange(recoveryScore, adaptationScore)
// Updates: volume_landmarks.current_volume → next week's workout_exercises.sets
```

#### 3. Nutrition RP Diet Coach Integration
```typescript
// Meal Timing with RP Methodology
const mealPlan = await RPDietCoach.generateMealPlan(userId, workoutSchedule)
// Creates: meal_timing_preferences → meal_macro_distribution → nutrition_logs
// Applies: RP nutrient timing (pre-workout carbs, post-workout protein)
```

#### 4. Analytics Data Pipeline
```typescript
// Comprehensive Analytics with Time Synchronization
const analytics = await AnalyticsService.getComprehensiveAnalytics(userId, days)
// Aggregates: nutrition_logs + workout_sessions + body_metrics + auto_regulation_feedback
// Returns: overview.weightChange, training.consistency, nutrition.adherence, feedback.recoveryScore
```

#### 5. Data Quality & Synchronization
```typescript
// Enhanced Date Handling with created_at Priority
const sortedData = data.sort((a, b) => {
  const dateComparison = new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date)
  return dateComparison === 0 ? new Date(a.created_at) - new Date(b.created_at) : dateComparison
})
// Ensures: Latest entry priority for same-date multiple entries
// Time Sync: TimeSyncService.getCurrentTime() for accurate date operations
```

### Data Validation Rules

#### Required Foreign Key Relationships
- workout_sessions.mesocycle_id → mesocycles.id (NOT NULL for mesocycle-based sessions)
- workout_exercises.session_id → workout_sessions.id (NOT NULL)
- auto_regulation_feedback.session_id → workout_sessions.id (NOT NULL)
- volume_landmarks.user_id → users.id (NOT NULL)
- volume_landmarks.muscle_group_id → muscle_groups.id (NOT NULL)

#### Data Type Constraints
- All decimal fields: precision: 5, scale: 2 (e.g., 999.99 format)
- All percentage fields: 0-100 range validation
- RPE/RIR fields: 1-10 integer range
- Boolean fields: explicit true/false (not nullable unless specified)
- Array fields: use .array() method syntax in schema definition

#### Critical Null Handling
- workout_sessions.program_id: nullable (mesocycle sessions don't require program)
- workout_exercises.actual_reps: nullable (until exercise completed)

- `PUT /api/training/sessions/:sessionId/complete` - Mark workout complete
- `POST /api/training/session/complete` - Alternative completion endpoint

**Load Progression Routes:**
- `GET /api/training/load-progression/:userId` - Historical progression data
- `POST /api/training/load-progression` - Record new progression data

#### State Management & Data Flow

**React Query Integration:**
```typescript
// Session data with automatic cache invalidation
const { data: session, isLoading } = useQuery<WorkoutSession>({
  queryKey: ["/api/training/session", sessionId],
});

// Exercise recommendations with RP methodology
const { data: recommendations = [] } = useQuery<ExerciseRecommendation[]>({
  queryKey: ["/api/training/exercise-recommendations", sessionId],
  enabled: !!sessionId && !!session
});
```

**Local State Management:**
- `workoutData: Record<number, WorkoutSet[]>` - Core workout state by exercise ID
- `currentExerciseIndex: number` - Active exercise navigation
- `currentSetIndex: number` - Active set within current exercise
- `isRestTimerActive: boolean` - Rest period management
- `restTimeRemaining: number` - Countdown timer state

#### Auto-Save & Data Persistence System

**Data Restoration from Database:**
- Checks `exercise.setsData` for previously saved progress
- Restores individual set completion states, weights, reps, RPE
- Falls back to prefilled values from mesocycle progression

**Auto-Save Mechanism:**
- Progress saved via `saveProgressMutation` when "Save & Exit" clicked
- Updates `setsData` JSONB field with individual set completion states
- Preserves dynamic set count changes (add/remove sets)
- Maintains exercise completion status

**Save & Exit Data Structure:**
```typescript
const progressData = {
  duration: Math.round((Date.now() - sessionStartTime) / 1000 / 60),
  totalVolume: completedSets.reduce((sum, set) => sum + (set.weight * set.actualReps), 0),
  isCompleted: false,
  exercises: session.exercises.map(exercise => ({
    exerciseId: exercise.exerciseId,
    sets: workoutData[exercise.id] || []
  }))
};
```

#### Set Management & Dynamic Functionality

**Dynamic Set Operations:**
- `addSet(exerciseId)` - Add new set with smart defaults from last set
- `removeSet(exerciseId, setIndex)` - Remove incomplete sets only
- `updateSet(exerciseId, setIndex, field, value)` - Real-time field updates
- Automatic set number recalculation on add/remove

**Set Completion Logic:**
- Validates weight and reps before allowing completion
- Triggers rest timer based on `exercise.restPeriod`
- Auto-advances to next set or next exercise
- Visual feedback with completion states

#### Exercise Recommendations & RP Integration

**Recommendation Display:**
- Shows recommended weight, reps, RPE from mesocycle progression
- Includes reasoning (e.g., "Week 2 progression", "Previous performance adjusted")
- Real-time recommendation fetching per session

**Load Progression Integration:**

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Traditional Chinese (ZH-TW) for all technical explanations and general communication.

**Design Preferences:**
- Sharp corner design aesthetic (border-radius: 0) - completely implemented across entire UI system
- No rounded elements anywhere in the interface - user strongly prefers square corners
- Animated progress bars should be maintained for visual appeal
- Condensed list view layouts preferred for mobile optimization

**Data Integrity Requirements:**
- All RP components must use synchronized data sources from weekly goals API
- Adherence percentages, weight changes, and energy levels must match across RP Analysis and Progress Metrics
- Consistent API query parameters required: `/api/weekly-goals?weekStartDate=<specific_week>`

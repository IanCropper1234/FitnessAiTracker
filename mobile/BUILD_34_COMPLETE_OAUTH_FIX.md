# Build 34 - Complete Fix for BOTH Apple & Google OAuth

## 🚨 Both OAuth Methods Failed in Build 32/33

### Error Messages:
- **Apple Sign In**: "The authorization attempt failed for an unknown reason"
- **Google Sign In**: "undefined is not a function"

## 🎯 Root Cause: Missing Native Module Plugins

The error **"undefined is not a function"** for Google happens at:
```javascript
AuthSession.startAsync({  // ← This function is undefined!
  authUrl,
  returnUrl: redirectUri
});
```

This means the native modules weren't linked in the build!

## ✅ Complete Fix Applied to app.json

### Before (Build 32/33):
```json
"plugins": [
  "expo-secure-store",
  "expo-web-browser"  // Missing critical OAuth plugins!
]
```

### After (Build 34):
```json
"plugins": [
  "expo-apple-authentication",  // ← For Apple Sign In
  "expo-secure-store",         // ← For token storage
  "expo-web-browser",          // ← For OAuth browser
  "expo-auth-session",         // ← For Google OAuth flow
  "expo-crypto"                // ← For PKCE security
]
```

## 📋 Why Each Plugin is Essential

| Plugin | Purpose | Without It |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **expo-apple-authentication** | Native Apple Sign In | "authorization failed" error |
| **expo-web-browser** | Opens browser for OAuth | Browser won't open |
| **expo-auth-session** | OAuth session management | "undefined is not a function" |
| **expo-crypto** | PKCE code generation | Security features fail |
| **expo-secure-store** | Secure token storage | Can't save sessions |

## 🔍 Google OAuth Specific Requirements

For Google Sign In to work:
1. ✅ **expo-auth-session** plugin (provides `AuthSession.startAsync`)
2. ✅ **expo-web-browser** plugin (opens OAuth browser)
3. ✅ **expo-crypto** plugin (generates PKCE codes)
4. ✅ Google Client IDs configured in app.json
5. ✅ URL scheme configured ("mytrainpro")

## 🔍 Apple OAuth Specific Requirements

For Apple Sign In to work:
1. ✅ **expo-apple-authentication** plugin
2. ✅ "usesAppleSignIn": true in app.json
3. ✅ Apple credentials configured on backend

## 🚀 Build 34 Command (Final)

```bash
cd mobile

# Verify all 5 plugins are configured
echo "Checking plugins configuration..."
grep -E "expo-apple-authentication|expo-web-browser|expo-auth-session|expo-crypto|expo-secure-store" app.json

# Clean everything
rm -rf ios android .expo node_modules/.cache

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Generate iOS project with all plugins
npx expo prebuild --clear-cache --platform ios

# Build with EAS
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## 📱 Expected Results in Build 34

### Google Sign In Flow:
1. User taps "Continue with Google"
2. **Browser opens** (expo-web-browser working)
3. **OAuth session starts** (expo-auth-session working)
4. **PKCE security active** (expo-crypto working)
5. User completes Google login
6. Returns to app authenticated

### Apple Sign In Flow:
1. User taps "Sign in with Apple"
2. **Native dialog appears** (expo-apple-authentication working)
3. User authenticates with Face ID/Touch ID
4. Returns to app authenticated

### Email Login Flow:
1. User taps "Continue with Email"
2. WebView loads login page
3. User enters credentials
4. Logs in successfully

## ✨ Key Differences from Failed Builds

| Component | Build 32/33 | Build 34 |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Plugins in app.json | 2 plugins | **5 plugins** |
| expo-apple-authentication | ❌ Missing | ✅ Configured |
| expo-auth-session | ❌ Missing | ✅ Configured |
| expo-crypto | ❌ Missing | ✅ Configured |
| Google OAuth | ❌ undefined is not a function | ✅ Will work |
| Apple OAuth | ❌ authorization failed | ✅ Will work |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After installing Build 34 from TestFlight:

**Google Sign In:**
- [ ] Tap button → Browser opens
- [ ] Complete Google login
- [ ] Returns to app logged in
- [ ] Session persists

**Apple Sign In:**
- [ ] Tap button → Native dialog appears
- [ ] Authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID
- [ ] Returns to app logged in
- [ ] Session persists

**Email Login:**
- [ ] Tap button → Login page loads
- [ ] Enter credentials
- [ ] Successfully logs in
- [ ] Session persists

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Build 34 is successful when:
- NO "undefined is not a function" errors
- NO "authorization failed" errors
- ALL three auth methods work
- Sessions persist across app restarts

## 📝 Summary

The critical issue was that OAuth native modules weren't being included in the build because they weren't listed in the app.json plugins. Even though the packages were installed, without plugin configuration, the native code doesn't get linked.

Build 34 fixes this by properly configuring ALL required plugins!

# Build 31 - Fix Notes

## 🎯 Problem Fixed
- iOS app was showing native auth UI with only Google/Apple login options
- Email/password login was missing
- OAuth logins were not working

## ✅ Solution Applied
- Commented out native auth UI in App.js (lines 833-876)
- App now loads WebView directly to show mytrainpro.com website
- Users can use full website login functionality:
  - Email/Password login
  - Google OAuth login  
  - Apple OAuth login
  - Sign Up option

## 📱 How It Works Now
1. App launches → Shows WebView with mytrainpro.com
2. User logs in using any method on the website
3. After login, user continues using the website in the app
4. Session is maintained within the WebView

## 🔧 To Re-enable Native Auth
If you want to re-enable the native auth UI later:
1. Open mobile/App.js
2. Uncomment lines 833-876
3. Build a new version

## 🚀 Build Instructions
```bash
cd mobile
rm -rf node_modules ios android
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

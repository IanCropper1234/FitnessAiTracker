# Build 32 - Hybrid Authentication

## 🎯 Problem Solved
- Email/password login works in WebView ✅
- But Google/Apple OAuth didn't work in WebView (no popups/redirects)
- Users need all authentication methods to work

## ✅ Solution: Hybrid Authentication Mode

### How It Works:
1. **Native OAuth Buttons** - Google and Apple Sign In use native SDKs (works perfectly)
2. **Email Option** - "Continue with Email" button opens WebView for email/password login
3. **Best of Both Worlds** - OAuth works natively, email/password works in WebView

### User Flow:
```
App Opens → Native Auth Screen
├── Google Button → Native Google OAuth → Success → Load WebView with session
├── Apple Button → Native Apple OAuth → Success → Load WebView with session  
└── Email Button → Load WebView → User logs in with email/password → Success
```

## 📱 Features:
- ✅ Google OAuth (Native)
- ✅ Apple OAuth (Native)
- ✅ Email/Password Login (WebView)
- ✅ Sign Up option (WebView)
- ✅ Forgot Password (WebView)

## 🚀 Build Instructions
```bash
cd mobile
rm -rf node_modules ios android
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## 📝 Changes Made:
1. Re-enabled native auth UI with modifications
2. Added "Continue with Email" button
3. Added showWebViewAuth state to control WebView display
4. Added divider UI element for better UX
5. Styled email button to match design

## 🔧 Technical Details:
- Native OAuth uses expo-auth-session and expo-apple-authentication
- WebView loads mytrainpro.com for email authentication
- Session management works for both auth methods
- After successful auth, WebView loads with injected session

# Build 30 iOS Crash Diagnosis

## 🔍 All Possible Crash Causes

### 1. **expo-apple-authentication Module Issue** ⚠️
- Package is installed but native module not linking
- Warning persists: "Install expo-apple-authentication to enable this feature"
- **Solution**: The native module will be linked during EAS build, not local prebuild

### 2. **WebView SSL/Certificate Issues** 🔐
- mytrainpro.com domain may have SSL certificate problems
- iOS may reject the connection
- **Test**: Check if https://mytrainpro.com loads in Safari

### 3. **Missing Native Dependencies** 📦
- expo-apple-authentication requires native iOS SDK components
- These are only added during EAS build, not local prebuild
- **Solution**: Build with EAS, not local Xcode

### 4. **React Native Version Mismatch** ✅
- Fixed: Updated from 0.79.6 to 0.79.5
- WebView updated from 13.6.4 to 13.13.5
- All packages now match Expo SDK 53

### 5. **JavaScript Runtime Errors** 💥
- App.js renders AppleAuthenticationButton immediately
- If module isn't available, it crashes before error boundary
- **Solution**: Added try-catch in availability check

## 🚀 Build 30 Instructions

```bash
cd mobile

# Build WITHOUT EXPO_NO_CAPABILITY_SYNC
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Why Local Warnings Don't Matter

The warning "Install expo-apple-authentication" appears in LOCAL prebuild but:
1. EAS Build runs on macOS with CocoaPods
2. Native modules are linked during EAS build, not local prebuild
3. The warning is expected on non-macOS systems

## 📱 What Happens During EAS Build

1. Detects expo-apple-authentication in package.json ✅
2. Links native iOS module via CocoaPods ✅
3. Adds Apple Sign In entitlement ✅
4. Creates proper provisioning profile ✅

## 🎯 If Build 30 Still Crashes

If the app still crashes after Build 30, the issue is likely:
1. **Domain Issue**: mytrainpro.com SSL/DNS problem
2. **Account Issue**: New Apple Developer account missing configuration
3. **Device Logs**: Need to check actual crash logs from device

To get crash logs:
1. Connect iPhone to Mac
2. Open Console app
3. Filter for "MyTrainPro"
4. Install app and capture crash

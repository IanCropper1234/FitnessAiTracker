# PWA Installation Feature Implementation Prompt

I need you to add Progressive Web App (PWA) installation functionality to my web app on Replit. Please implement the following:

## Requirements

### 1. Create/Update Web App Manifest
- Create a `manifest.json` file with:
  - App name and short name
  - App description
  - Icons (at least 192x192 and 512x512)
  - Theme color and background color
  - Display mode: "standalone"
  - Start URL: "/"
  - Scope: "/"

### 2. Create Service Worker
- Create a `service-worker.js` file that:
  - Caches essential app resources
  - Implements offline functionality
  - Uses Cache First strategy for static assets
  - Uses Network First strategy for dynamic content

### 3. Implement Install Prompt Handler
Create functionality that:
- Captures the `beforeinstallprompt` event
- Stores the event for later use
- Shows a custom install button/banner when appropriate
- Triggers the browser's install prompt when user clicks
- Tracks installation outcome (accepted/dismissed)
- Hides the install UI if already installed
- Detects if app is running in standalone mode

### 4. Create Install UI Component
Design a user-friendly install prompt that:
- Appears after user has engaged with the app (e.g., after 30 seconds or specific action)
- Has a clear call-to-action button
- Explains benefits of installing
- Can be easily dismissed
- Doesn't reappear too frequently (use localStorage to track dismissals)
- Is mobile-responsive

### 5. Update HTML
- Link the manifest file in `<head>`
- Register the service worker
- Include meta tags for mobile optimization
- Add theme-color meta tag

## Technical Specifications

### File Structure Expected:
```
/
├── index.html
├── manifest.json
├── service-worker.js
├── icons/
│   ├── icon-192x192.png
│   └── icon-512x512.png
└── js/
    └── install.js (or inline in index.html)
```

### Key Features to Include:

1. **Smart Install Timing**: Only show install prompt after user engagement
2. **Prevent Spam**: Don't show prompt if dismissed recently (e.g., within 7 days)
3. **Platform Detection**: Handle both Android (Chrome) and iOS (Safari) appropriately
4. **Visual Feedback**: Show loading states and success messages
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle when install prompt is not available

### Replit-Specific Considerations:
- Use relative paths for all resources
- Ensure HTTPS (Replit provides this by default)
- Make sure the service worker scope is correct
- Test with Replit's preview URL structure

## Code Style Preferences:
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Add clear comments explaining key functionality
- Use semantic HTML
- Implement responsive CSS (mobile-first)
- Keep code modular and maintainable

## Expected Behavior:
1. When user first visits → App loads normally, install prompt is captured but not shown
2. After 30 seconds of engagement → Custom install UI appears
3. User clicks "Install" → Browser's native install dialog appears
4. After installation → Install UI is permanently hidden
5. If user dismisses → Don't show again for 7 days
6. If already installed → Never show install UI

## Testing Checklist:
Please ensure:
- [ ] Manifest is valid (test with Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] Service Worker registers successfully
- [ ] App can be installed on mobile devices
- [ ] App works offline (at least shows cached content)
- [ ] Install button appears and functions correctly
- [ ] App detects when already installed
- [ ] Works on both desktop and mobile Chrome
- [ ] iOS Safari shows "Add to Home Screen" instructions

## Additional Notes:
- Provide placeholder icons if actual icons aren't available (but note where I should replace them)
- Include console.log statements for debugging
- Add comments explaining browser compatibility
- Suggest improvements based on my existing app structure

Please implement all of these features and explain what you've added and where I need to customize (like app name, description, icons, etc.).

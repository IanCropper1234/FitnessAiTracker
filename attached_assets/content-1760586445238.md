# App Homepage

#### **General Guidance**

As a reminder, your app homepage must meet the following requirements:

- Accurately represent and identify you app or brand
- Fully describe your apps functionality to users
- Explain with transparency the purpose for which your app requests user data
- Hosted on a verified domain you own
- Your homepage and privacy policy should not be hosted on a third-party platform where you can't verify that you own your subdomain. For example: Google Sites, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
- Include a link to your privacy policy (Note: this link should match the link you added on your consent screen configuration)
- Visible to users without requiring them to log-in to your app

**Important!** Not meeting these requirements can slow down the verification process. Please make sure your homepage has met the above criteria before including it in your submission.

You have provided us with an unresponsive homepage URL

Your home page submission must be easy to access, easy to understand, and relevant to the app you have submitted for verification.

If you have been flagged for an unresponsive homepage URL, follow these steps to  update your [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) submission with an accessible URL to your homepage:

1. Go to the OAuth consent screen page for your project. You can find it by updating the following URL with your project ID: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project= **\[PROJECT\_ID\]**

2. Update the required homepage URL field.

3. Once the URL is updated, click Prepare for verification at the bottom of the last page.

4. On the Prepare for verification screen, confirm that the information is correct, then click Submit for verification on the final page.


**Helpful tip!** This is also a great opportunity to make sure your homepage meets all other app homepage requirements. Doing so will help expedite the remainder of the verification process.

The website you provided as your homepage is not registered to you

We require that you verify the ownership of your application homepage. If you have been flagged for an unverified homepage domain, please proceed with the best option below for your project.

#### **Option 1: Verify your existing app homepage**

Follow [these instructions to verify](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en) the submitted homepage belongs to you. Respond to the email you received to confirm that ownership has been verified.

#### **Option 2: Submit another homepage for verification which has already been verified as registered to you**

If you have an alternative home page for your app hosted on an existing domain that is registered to you, you can resubmit for verification with the verified domain.

Once you have resolved this and all other issues, [resubmit your verification request](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914#submit-app-ver&zippy=%2Csteps-to-submit-your-app) in the Cloud Console with the verified homepage URL.

**Important!** Only resubmit your verification request once you have addressed all issues with your submission.

The provided homepage URL redirects to a different domain than the one listed on the OAuth consent screen

To avoid ambiguity for users, your app homepage URL must be static and cannot redirect to a different URL or domain. The homepage linked on your consent screen must match the link presented in-browser to a user.

If your homepage URL has been flagged for redirecting to a different domain, please follow the steps below.

#### **Update your OAuth consent screen configuration to directly link to your homepage:**

1. Go to the OAuth consent screen page for your project. You can find it by updating the following URL with your project ID: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project= **\[PROJECT\_ID\]**

2. Update the required homepage URL field with a static URL.

3. Once the URL is updated, click Prepare for verification at the bottom of the last page.

4. On the Prepare for verification screen, confirm that the information is correct, then click Submit for verification on the final page.


The provided homepage domain appears to be a shortened or condensed link

To avoid ambiguity for users, the homepage URL linked on your consent screen must match the link presented in-browser. If you provided us with a shortened or condensed link to your homepage, we ask that you update your OAuth consent screen configuration to provide the full domain. For example: [https://www.google.com/about](https://www.google.com/about) is a valid domain; [https://www.g.co/about](https://www.g.co/about) is an invalid domain.

#### **Update your OAuth Consent screen configuration with a non-shortened URL for your app homepage:**

1. Go to the OAuth consent screen page for your project. You can find it by updating the following URL with your project ID: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project= **\[PROJECT\_ID\]**

2. Update the required homepage URL field with a static URL.

3. Once the URL is updated, click Prepare for verification at the bottom of the last page.

4. On the Prepare for verification screen, confirm that the information is correct, then click Submit for verification on the final page.


Your homepage is behind a login page

Users should be able to easily understand the purpose of your application and why you require their Google user data.

This issue indicates your homepage **requires user login** to view any details about your application. Please proceed with the best option below for your project:

#### **Option 1: Update your existing app homepage to allow users to view information about your app without needing to login**

1. Update your homepage to describe the purpose of the application without requiring login.

2. Respond to the email you received to confirm that your app homepage has been updated.


#### **Option 2: Update your consent screen with a different app homepage that is not behind a login page**

1. Go to the OAuth consent screen page for your project. You can find it by updating the following URL with your project ID: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project= **\[PROJECT\_ID\]**

2. Update the required homepage URL field with a new homepage URL.

3. Once the URL is updated, click Prepare for verification at the bottom of the last page.
4. On the Prepare for verification screen, confirm that the information is correct, then click Submit for verification on the final page.

**Helpful tip!** This is also a great opportunity to make sure your homepage meets all other app homepage requirements. Doing so will help expedite the remainder of the verification process.
